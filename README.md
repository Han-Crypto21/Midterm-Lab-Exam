# Student Information System

## Description
The Student Information System is a simple Node.js application that allows users to manage student records efficiently. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, ensuring that data is stored locally using a JSON file. This project was created as part of the Midterm Laboratory Exam for BSIT students at Panpacific University.
